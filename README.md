# Embedding-ML-model-in-API
Welcome to the Sepsis Classification Project repository! In this project, we've built a Machine Learning model, created a RESTful API, and containerized our application with Docker. The primary objective of this project is to develop a classification model to predict whether patients test positive or negative for Sepsis, a life-threatening condition.

## Project Description
### What is Sepsis?
Sepsis is the body's severe response to an infection and can be life-threatening. It occurs when an existing infection triggers a chain reaction throughout the body. Most commonly, bacterial infections are the primary cause of sepsis. Individuals at risk of developing sepsis include:

Adults aged 65 and above.
Children under one year old.
People with chronic conditions such as diabetes, lung disease, or cancer.
Individuals with weakened immune systems, among others.
This project is a classification task, with the goal of predicting whether a given input belongs to the "Negative" or "Positive" class, offering a valuable diagnostic tool.

## Hypothesis
In this project, we explored the relationship between high plasma glucose levels and the likelihood of developing Sepsis. We set up the following hypotheses:

Null Hypothesis: There is no significant relationship between high plasma glucose levels and Sepsis.
Alternative Hypothesis: There is a significant relationship between high plasma glucose levels and Sepsis.
## Analytical Questions
Throughout the project, we addressed several analytical questions to gain insights into the data:

Distribution of Ages: We analyzed the distribution of ages for patients captured in the dataset to understand age demographics.

Age and Sepsis: We investigated which age groups are more prone to developing sepsis, providing valuable demographic insights.

Blood Parameters and Sepsis: We explored whether blood parameters have any associations with sepsis, potentially identifying relevant biomarkers.

Body Mass and Sepsis: We examined whether body mass is directly correlated with a patient's tendency to develop sepsis.

Plasma Glucose and Age: We analyzed whether plasma glucose levels are affected by age, shedding light on potential age-related factors.

## How to Use This Repository
You can clone this repository and explore the resources, code, and notebooks in the /notebooks and /src directories to gain a deeper understanding of the project. The /model and /docker directories contain relevant model and Dockerization files, respectively.
